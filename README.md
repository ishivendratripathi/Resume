# CV Generator

This project is a simple CV generator app that allows users to create and customize their CVs by inputting data.

## Overview

The CV Generator is built using React and powered by [Vite](https://vite.dev/), a modern build tool that offers a faster and leaner developer experience. This project was developed both as a learning exercise and a showcase of skills in component design and React development.

## Key Features

- **Reusable Component Architecture:**<br>
  Inspired by the [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) library, the app emphasizes modular and reusable components. This approach ensures consistency and scalability.


## How It's Built

- **Frontend Framework:** React (via Vite for faster development).
- **Component Design:** Reusable primitives inspired by shadcn/ui.
- **Styling:** Custom CSS Modules to mitigate style conflicts and ensure scoped styling.
- **Deployment:** Deployed using Vercel.

## Learning Journey
